# ðŸ“… Day 4 â€“ JavaScript Challenge  
## ðŸ”¹ Focus: Functions

Functions = Superpowers unlocked ðŸ§ âš¡  
Today I learned how to **bundle logic**, **reuse code**, and **make my programs cleaner** using JavaScript functions. From basic declarations to arrow functions and calling functions with arguments â€” itâ€™s all starting to click!

---

## ðŸ’» What I Covered Today

- Function declarations
- Function expressions
- Arrow functions `() => {}`
- Returning values
- Calling functions multiple times
- Passing data into and out of functions

## ðŸ›  Mini Project â€“ BMI Calculator

### Coding Challenge #4

Youâ€™re building a simple **BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator** using functions. This will use everything from **inputs**, **calculation logic**, and **returning results**.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Your Tasks:

1. Create a function called `calculateBMI(weight, height)` that:
   - Accepts weight (kg) and height (meters)
   - Returns the BMI using: `bmi = weight / height^2`
2. Create a second function called `interpretBMI(bmi)` that:
   - Accepts a BMI number
   - Returns a category:
     - BMI < 18.5 â†’ "Underweight"
     - BMI 18.5 - 24.9 â†’ "Normal"
     - BMI 25 - 29.9 â†’ "Overweight"
     - BMI 30 and above â†’ "Obese"
3. Use template literals to print the full result:
   - `"Your BMI is 22.5, which means you are Normal âœ…"`

---

### ðŸ§¾ Sample Output:

```js
Input: weight = 70, height = 1.75
Output: Your BMI is 22.86, which means you are Normal âœ…
