# 📅 Day 7 – JavaScript Challenge  
## 🔁 Focus: Loops

Today was all about **LOOPS** — the magic that lets me repeat actions without writing the same code over and over again. It’s like giving my code superpowers to run automatically and handle data like a machine 🤖

---

## 💻 What I Covered Today

- `for` loop – basic structure and use cases
- `while` loop – runs as long as condition is true
- Looping through arrays with:
  - `for` loop
  - `while` loop
- Looping backward
- Looping through nested arrays
- Using `continue` and `break` inside loops

---

## 🧪 Task Activities

### 1. Loop Basics
- [x] Logged numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop
- [x] Printed even numbers from 1 to 20 using `if` inside a loop
- [x] Counted down from 10 to 1 using a loop

### 2. Looping Through Arrays
- [x] Created an array of favorite movies
- [x] Used a `for` loop to log each movie
- [x] Added a custom message using template literals

### 3. While Loop Practice
- [x] Simulated a countdown using `while`
- [x] Used `while` to keep asking a random number until it matched a target


## 🛠 Mini Project – Looping Student Scores

### Coding Challenge #7

You're given an array of student scores. You need to loop through it and analyze the results.

---

### 🎯 Your Tasks:

1. Create an array of numbers representing test scores
2. Use a `for` loop to:
   - Print each score
   - Calculate the total score
3. At the end, log the average score
4. Add logic to count how many students passed (score >= 50)
5. Bonus: Use a `while` loop to do the same thing
