# ðŸ“… Day 8 â€“ JavaScript Challenge  
## ðŸŽ® DOM Practice Game Project

Today, I took everything Iâ€™ve learned about the **DOM** and used it to create a fun, visual project â€” a **Static DOM-Based Game Setup**. The idea was to build a simple game layout using only JavaScript to **create, style, and display** elements on the page.

No event handling or user interaction yet â€” just DOM construction and styling with code ðŸ§±âœ¨

### ðŸ§± Project Features

- Create all elements using `document.createElement()`
- Add character element and stats using `.textContent`
- Style everything using `.style` or `.classList`
- Append elements in a proper structure:

### ðŸ§ª What I Practiced

- Using `document.createElement()` to generate HTML elements
- Updating content with `.textContent` and 
- Styling elements directly with `.style` (e.g., color, size, borders)
- Reusing code by creating reusable functions to build each character
