# 📅 Day 5 – JavaScript Challenge  
## 🔹 Focus: Arrays

Today I dove into the world of **arrays** — learning how to store, access, and manipulate multiple values in a single variable. From adding and removing items to looping through them, it’s starting to feel like I can handle real data now 🔁🧺

## 💻 What I Covered Today

- Declaring arrays with square brackets `[]`
- Accessing elements by index
- `.length` property
- Updating array values
- Array methods:
  - `.push()` – Add to end
  - `.pop()` – Remove from end
  - `.unshift()` – Add to beginning
  - `.shift()` – Remove from beginning
- Checking values with `.includes()` and `.indexOf()`

## 🧪 Task Activities

### 1. Array Basics
- [x] Created an array of my 5 favorite foods
- [x] Logged the first and last food using indexes
- [x] Replaced the third item with something else

### 2. Array Methods
- [x] Used `.push()` to add a new favorite
- [x] Used `.pop()` and logged the removed item
- [x] Used `.includes()` to check if “Pizza” was in the list
- [x] Used `.indexOf()` to find the position of “Rice”

### 3. Bonus Practice
- [x] Created an array of scores and calculated the average (manually)
- [x] Used `.length` to get dynamic array size

## 🛠 Mini Project – Simple To-Do List (Array Based)

### Coding Challenge #5

You're building a **simple to-do list** using arrays. It stores tasks and allows basic operations like adding, removing, and checking tasks.

---

### 🎯 Your Tasks:

1. Create an empty array called `todoList`
2. Add 3 tasks using `.push()`
3. Remove the last task using `.pop()`
4. Add a task to the beginning using `.unshift()`
5. Log the full list and its length
6. Check if a specific task exists using `.includes()`
