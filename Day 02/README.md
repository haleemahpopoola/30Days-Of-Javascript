# ðŸ“… Day 2 â€“ JavaScript Challenge  
## ðŸ”¹ Focus: Operators, Expressions, If/Else & Template Literals

Today was about getting hands-on with **logic**, **comparisons**, and **decision-making** in JS. I practiced with different types of operators, built some expressions, and made my first few `if/else` branches. Also tried out template literals â€” and yeah, way cleaner than string + string + string ðŸ˜…

## ðŸ’» What I Covered Today

- **Arithmetic operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`
- **Assignment operators**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.
- **Comparison operators**: `==`, `===`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- **Logical operators**: `&&`, `||`, `!`
- **Expressions vs Statements**
- **If / Else / Else If** statements
- **Template literals** using backticks and `${}`

## ðŸ§ª Task Activities

### 1. Operator Playground
- [x] Did basic math with variables
- [x] Tried modulus and exponentiation
- [x] Used `+=` and `-=` for counters
- [x] Compared two numbers using `==`, `===`, `!=`
- [x] Tried logical combos with `&&`, `||`, `!`

### 2. If/Else Flow
- [x] Wrote a simple age checker (`if age >= 18`)
- [x] Added an `else if` for underage and an `else` fallback
- [x] Tested with different values for conditions

### 3. Template Literals
- [x] Rewrote my old string concatenation lines
- [x] Embedded variables using `${}` inside backticks
- [x] Combined it with logic inside a template literal

## ðŸ›  Mini Project â€“ Grade Evaluator

### Coding Challenge #2

You are building a mini grading system that checks if a student **passes** or **fails** based on their average score.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Your Tasks:

1. **Calculate the average score** for a student using the three test scores provided.

2. Use `if/else if/else` statements to print the grade category:
   - 90 and above â†’ `Excellent`
   - 75 - 89 â†’ `Good`
   - 50 - 74 â†’ `Pass`
   - Below 50 â†’ `Fail`

3. **Bonus 1:** Add a **minimum attendance requirement**.  
   A student only passes if their average is at least 50 **AND** their attendance is at least 75%.  
   If not, they fail **regardless of score**.

4. **Bonus 2:** Use **template literals** to print a message like this:Student John has an average score of 82 and an attendance of 80%. Grade: Good 
Data 1: 78, 85, 70 â€” Attendance: 10

Bonus 1: 45, 55, 60 â€” Attendance: 8

Bonus 2: 92, 88, 96 â€” Attendance: 10
