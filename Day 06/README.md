# ðŸ“… Day 6 â€“ JavaScript Challenge  
## ðŸ”¹ Focus: Objects

Today I leveled up into the land of **Objects** ðŸ§± â€” the data structure that lets me group related info together in one place using key-value pairs. Objects make things way more descriptive and flexible, and Iâ€™m loving how clean my data is starting to look.

---

## ðŸ’» What I Covered Today

- Creating objects using `{}` syntax
- Defining properties (key-value pairs)
- Accessing values:
  - Dot notation (`object.key`)
  - Bracket notation (`object["key"]`)
- Updating and adding new properties
- Deleting properties with `delete`
- Nesting objects inside objects
- Using objects inside arrays (and vice versa)
- Adding methods (functions inside objects)
- The `this` keyword

---

## ðŸ§ª Task Activities

### 1. Object Basics
- [x] Created a `person` object with name, age, and country
- [x] Logged values using both dot and bracket notation
- [x] Updated the age and added a `hobby` key
- [x] Deleted the `country` property

### 2. Object with Method
- [x] Added a method `introduce()` that logs a message using `this.name`
- [x] Called the method and confirmed it works



## ðŸ›  Mini Project â€“ Digital Profile Card (Object Based)

### Coding Challenge #6

You're building a **digital profile card** using an object. This will include personal info, hobbies, and a method to introduce the user.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Your Tasks:

1. Create an object called `profile`
2. Add the following properties:
   - `fullName` (string)
   - `age` (number)
   - `hobbies` (array of strings)
   - `isStudent` (boolean)
3. Add a method `introduce()` that logs:
   - `"Hi, I'm John Doe, 20 years old. I enjoy: reading, gaming, coding."`
   - Use `this` to access properties
4. Log the full profile
5. Call the `introduce()` method
