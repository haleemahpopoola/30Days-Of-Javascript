# 📅 Day 3 – JavaScript Challenge  
## 🔹 Focus: Ternary Operator & Switch Statements

No `if/else` clutter today 😌 — today was all about writing cleaner and more elegant conditional logic using **ternary operators** and **switch statements**. It’s like writing short, snappy decisions in a single line. And of course, I played around with `switch` too for multiple options.

---

## 💻 What I Covered Today

- Ternary operator: `condition ? true : false`
- Nesting ternaries (carefully!)
- Using template literals with ternary expressions
- Practical comparison: Ternary vs `if/else`
- `switch` statement basics:
  - `case`, `break`, `default`

## 🧪 Task Activities

### 1. Ternary Training
- [x] Used ternary to log if a user is a minor or adult
- [x] Combined ternary with template literals for a clean message
- [x] Nested a ternary for grading: `Excellent`, `Good`, or `Fail`

### 2. Switch Practice
- [x] Wrote a day planner using switch statement
- [x] Used default fallback for invalid inputs

## 🛠 Coding Challenge – Meal Planner with Switch

### Coding Challenge #3

You're building a **Weekly Meal Planner** using a `switch` statement. Based on the day of the week, your program should print out a unique meal suggestion.

---

### 🎯 Your Tasks:

1. Accept a day of the week as input (e.g. `"Monday"`, `"tuesday"`, etc.).
2. Convert the input to lowercase to make it case-insensitive.
3. Use a `switch` statement to match the day to a meal.
4. Use a `default` case to handle invalid or unknown days.
5. Bonus: Combine **Saturday** and **Sunday** into one case (Weekend special).
