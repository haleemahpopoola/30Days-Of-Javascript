# 📅 Day 1 - JavaScript Challenge  
## 🔹 Focus: Variables & Data Types

This is my Day 1 log for JavaScript coding. I'm starting with the **basics**—just warming up with variables and types. Not teaching anyone here, this is for me 😌

---

## 💻 What I Covered Today

- Declaring variables using `let` and `const`
- Data types: `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Null`, `Undefined`
- Printing stuff with `console.log()`
- Checked types using `typeof`
- Played with type conversion

## 🧪 Task Activities

### 1. Variable Declarations
- [x] Made a `let` variable for my favorite number
- [x] Used `const` for birth year
- [x] Tried reassigning a `const` to see what error pops up

### 2. Data Types Practice
- [x] One `string` (fav color)
- [x] One `number` (shoe size)
- [x] One `boolean` (do I like pizza?)
- [x] One `null` value
- [x] One `undefined` variable

### 3. Console Playground
- [x] Logged all my variables
- [x] Used `typeof` on each

### 4. Bonus Task
- [x] Converted a number to a string with `String()`
- [x] Converted a boolean to a number with `Number()`

## 🧾 Mini Project: Personal Info Card

Just a quick script to print out a simple info card using variables.

- [x] Create a simple JavaScript script that stores personal details using variables and logs them as a styled "info card" in the console.
